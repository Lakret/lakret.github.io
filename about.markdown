Hey there! I'm Dmitry. I live in Berlin, and work as a backend team lead at [Lana Labs](https://lanalabs.com/en/).

I specialize in functional and distributed, and technical team leadership. I also enjoy product and UX work.

I'm a polyglot programmer, with a preference for dynamically typed and REPL-friendly functional programming languages.
Elixir is my darling, but I also like Erlang, and Clojure. On the static side of the house, I prefer ML-family languages, e.g. OCaml or F#.


For the most performance critical parts of the systems I build I tend to use Rust, and I don't mind adding some Python,
Scala, or JavaScript code where needed.

I have extensive production experience with all of those, except for Clojure. In my free time I tinker with all kinds of different
languages and programming paradigms. I was always fascinated by software architecture, and interplay between modularity & language features.
